# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created code and unit tests to reverse an array without using another array.

**Thoughts:** This was way harder than I expected.  I'm not happy with the naming but I created a separate class with a method to do the reversing of the string input.  I expect that there is a better way to acheive this too by calling the [Linq reverse method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb358497(v=vs.110).aspx) but I'm not sure how to acheive this.  I also created a unit test and want to create unit tests for 100 days of code.
