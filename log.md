# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created code and unit tests to reverse an array without using another array.

**Thoughts**: This was way harder than I expected.  I'm not happy with the naming but I created a separate class with a method to do the reversing of the string input.  I expect that there is a better way to acheive this too by calling the [Linq reverse method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb358497(v=vs.110).aspx) but I'm not sure how to acheive this.  I also created a unit test and want to create unit tests for 100 days of code.

### Day 1: May 1, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Created code and unit tests to produce a sample output based on two integers as input.

**Thoughts**: This was a little easier after day 0 but I ended up creating the repo with a different tree structure.  I'm not clear why.  I need to refactor this.  I also added a unit test which fails, again it's unclear why, as both the result from the method call and the execpted result appear to be the same visually in debug mode i.e. both a generic List<int> with the same number if items and each item has the same value.  Perhaps there is another way to compare generic lists.

**UPDATE: Day 1:** Unit tests now passing.  Collections should be compared in unit tests using CollectionsAssert.AreEqual as per this Stack Overflow [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11055632/how-to-compare-lists-in-unit-testing).

### Day 2: May 2, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Created code and unit tests to return Maximum and Minimum Temperatures from an array of floats.

**Thoughts**: This challenge was easier that the previous days and in the class I included two public properties.

### Day 3: May3, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Creaed code and unit tests to return a sorted list of integers from a list of 3 integers.

**Thoughts**: I feel I cheated a little on this one by using the sort method on a list in the System.Collections.Generic.
It was still difficult trying to do it in a class.  
I wouldn't mind trying to implement an actual sorting algorithm in a class rather than using the sort method.
